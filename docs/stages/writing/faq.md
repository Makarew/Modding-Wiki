## I'm getting errors (parts of the code underlined in red) for a few files when opening the codebase in IntelliJ idea

This is due to the decompilation not being good enough for a few functions. Unless you're looking to repack the file containing such functions specifically, you can either ignore such errors or simply comment the offending functions' body to get rid of them.

As the codebase will get cleaner these errors will hopefully disappear.
